# CampusMaps


This app is still in development. 
CampusMaps is an application function meant to help those with accessibilities and provides a means of optimal travel from location to another on a univeristy campus.

Purpose 
The product whose software requirements are specified in this document is CampusMap, an application that will help students at Towson University find the best and fastest ways to navigate the campus. The scope of CampusMap that is covered in this SRS is the entire application. The revision number for this current SRS is Version 1.0.
Document Conventions
For the purposes of this SRS, priorities for high-level requirements are assumed to be inherited by detailed requirements. No highlights have been done to this document, nor does the font have any significance on the document itself.
Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions

This document wouldn’t be very useful for users, since all they would really need to know is how the program works. Developers, project managers, and marketing staff are the main intended audiences for this document. The rest of this SRS contains details on the project, such as what environment it will be made in, the functions of the program that will be created, the various assumptions and dependencies, and many other things. Below are bulleted lists of the reading order of the various individuals listed above. To be honest, the best reading order would probably just be in-order, to give an overview of the project for whoever reads it.
Product Scope
This software is being created to help students at Towson University with disabilities (and even those without) navigate Towson and get to where they need to go in a timely manner and without confusion. This software will be in the form of an app, which we hope to make available to all platforms. I am not entirely sure if exclusions are necessary here, as the entire project is just the app, unless we need to state that we’re not giving a free phone/computer to people who want to use the app.This app will allow users to input a desired room/building on the TU campus, then the app will guide them using the best path so they can reach their destination in the quickest possible time. It will also allow users to suggest alternative, potentially quicker paths. 

Note: Aspects of this build is still in the works and will be updated through patches.
